# Psychometrics and Credit Risk Assessment

The integration of psychometric tools in credit risk assessment primarily seeks to estimate individuals' propensity to pay. This approach stems from a desire for inclusivity, as it allows for the consideration of future expectations linked to each applicant's personality traits. This method stands out over traditional approaches that focus exclusively on tangible factors, such as credit history (Ayling, 2018).

The foundation of this model comes from research in the economic field, like the study by Goldfayn and Vellekoop (2018), which demonstrated a significant correlation between positive personality traits and the various stages of credit access. Studies have shown that it's less likely to reject credit applications from individuals with positive tendencies in the Big Five dimensions, and that these same individuals exhibit responsible payment tendencies (Pirog & Roberts, 2007; Tian et al., 2022; Goldfayn & Vellekoop, 2018; Brown & Taylor, 2014).

## Dimensions of the Psychometric Score:

- **Conscientiousness**: Represents self-discipline, rationality, and prudence in interactions.

- **Extraversion**: Characterizes enthusiasm, sociability, and proactivity in dealing with others.

- **Neuroticism**: Highlights emotional instability, manifesting in anxiety, low tolerance, and difficulty facing setbacks.

- **Openness** to Experiences: Focuses on curiosity, innovation, and creativity towards the unknown.

- **Agreeableness**: Embodies altruistic tendencies like trust, empathy, and respect for others.


The test addresses the following statements under which the individual must position themselves:

I see myself as someone who...

1. Worries a lot.
2. Gets nervous easily.
3. Remains calm in tense situations. (R)
4.  Is talkative.
5.  Is extroverted, sociable.
6. Is reserved. (R)
7.  Is original, comes up with new ideas.
8. Values artistic and aesthetic experiences.
9. Has an active imagination.
10.  Is sometimes rude to others. (R)
11.  Has a merciful nature.
12. Is considerate and kind to almost everyone.
13. Does thorough work.
14. Tends to be lazy. (R)
15. Does things efficiently.

With the following response categories:

1. Never
2. Almost Never
3. Neutral
4. Almost Always
5. Always

It should be noted that questions 3, 6, 10, and 14 are measured on a reverse scale, meaning the responses to these questions are coded in the opposite or inverted manner compared to the other questions. That is, they are measured with the following response categories:

1. Always
2. Almost Always
3. Neutral
4. Almost Never
5. Never

With the Big Five dimensions as a foundation, the goal is to develop a model that classifies micro-entrepreneurs into two categories: good or bad payers. Various classification models will be explored in this process.
